# üõÇ Predicting H1B Visa Petition Outcomes

A data-driven classification project to predict the outcomes of H1B visa petitions based on historical application data. This project applies machine learning models to identify key factors contributing to visa approvals or denials.

---

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores patterns in H1B visa applications to predict whether a petition will be **certified** or **denied**. The focus is on preprocessing real-world datasets and applying classification models for predictive insights.

### Key outcomes include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding application trends by year, employer, and job category
- **Modeling**: Applying logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers
- **Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess performance

## üìÇ Project Structure

### Data Preprocessing  
- Encode categorical variables (like job title, location, employer name)  
- Remove duplicates and handle missing values  
- Balance the dataset if required using techniques like SMOTE  

### Machine Learning Models  
- Train-test split (typically 80-20)  
- Fit models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Evaluate using classification metrics
